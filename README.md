# bothub.py
**Bothub.py** is a Python package used to simplify the creation of bots as scripts.

Currently, you can create bots with Scratchconnect or Selenium. While Selenium is a simpler module, it has a lot of useful functions and, of course, Scratchconnect offers a great way for scripts to interact with Scratch via commands. 

We hope to add a Twilio Voice interface soon as well as a SMS protocol.
